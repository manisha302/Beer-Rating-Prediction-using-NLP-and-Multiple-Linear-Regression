# Beer-Rating-Prediction-using-NLP-and-Multiple-Linear-Regression

In this mini-project i have used beer-dataset in which we have lots of attributes like beer style, beer smell,reviews ,taste etc so i have used multiple regression on numerical atributes to see each of their effect on beer-rating prediction and there was also a text review in which i have used NLP techniques like text proprocessing which includes conversion to lowercase,stop words removal,punctuation removal,stemming and then applied TF-IDF vectorizer and then applied Passive-Aggressive-Classifier and Multinomial-Naive-bayes from which Multinomial-Naive-Bayes has given better accuracy
